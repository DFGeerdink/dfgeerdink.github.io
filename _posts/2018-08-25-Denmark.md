For the occasion of my fathers 60th birthday, my brother and I decider to relive an old tradition: Men's weekend. During our four day trip to the top of Denmark (Nordjylland) we stayed in a traditional wooden cottage in the dunes. Here we enjoyed the fireplace, piece and tranquility of the surroundings and playing games together.

Due to the long drive, on Friday evening we decided to walk to the beach, this was a nice and windy experience. Afterwards we prepared easy - but good - food, pancakes! Furthermore we visited Aalborg, a lively city with a sharp contract between modern art and architecture, and a rich history including its Viking age grave hill. The sunday was themed by natural wonders, including the 40 meter high sand dunes on which the 'Rubjerg Knud fyr' rests. This lighthouse is expected to drop into the sea due to erosion of the dunes in the year 2020. Last but not least we visited Skagen, the northernmost part of Denmark. A special sight is the point where the North Sea and the Baltic Sea meet. Here one can clearly see the surfs of the seas hit each other. 

An impression of the weekend:
