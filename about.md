# About
My name is Daan Geerdink, this page features relevant information which make the person I am today: *Curious, enthousiastic and a lover of life.* This website displays those key aspects and the creative projects that result from it. My leisure activities comprise of videography, gymnastics and being outdoors.

### Education
I'm a master student in Chemical Engineering at TU Delft, driven by curiosity and profound interest in applied sciences & IT. I love to unify Python and big data in ways that allow for spending time on what really matters: using creativity and scientific methods to generate insights from vast amounts and diverse types of data. I am at my best when allowed to think big whilst also being a solution-oriented perfectionist. Furthermore, I enjoy helping other people thrive in their personal and professional development.
