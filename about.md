## About

I'm a student in Chemical Engineering at TU Delft, driven by curiosity and profound interest in applied sciences & IT. I love to unify Python and big data in ways that allow for spending time on what really matters: using creativity and scientific methods to generate insights from vast amounts and diverse types of data. I am at my best when allowed to think big whilst also being a solution-oriented perfectionist. I enjoy helping other people thrive. Leisure activities comprise of videography, gymnastics and being outdoors.
