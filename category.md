## Blog Categories

I have clustered my creative projects into several categories:
**Videography**, **Travel**, **Coding** and **Technology**.

### <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/category/videography">Videography</a>
Making videos has always bothered me. Endless experimenting with LEGO stop-motion movies when younger has resulted in extensive knowledge of (open source) visual computing. Late 2016 marks the beginning of my Videography hobby, with the succesive purchase of a Sony a6000 system camera, Moza Air Gimbal Stabilizer, DJI Spark drone and numerous accesoires. I like to capture memorable events and incredible nature.
### <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/category/travel">Travel</a>
Having been fortunate to travel a good part of Europe, Northern America and a three month roadtrip in Australia has made me somewhat of a globetrotter. Of the latter I have extensively shared my experiences.
### <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/category/coding">Coding</a>
Coding has interested me from the day I was introduced to it. From Game Maker and programming on my graphical calculator in Visual Basic in highschool to creating custom websites, doing ethical hacking to being a professional Data Engineer in Python. I'll gladly share some of my experiences.
### <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/category/technology">Technology</a>
Advances in technology have been an area that I have closely followed, it is one of my favorite subjects while enjoying a beer with friends.
